# AgriTech Tunisia: Smart Farming for Sustainability

## Project Overview
AgriTech Tunisia is a smart agriculture platform designed to help Tunisian farmers optimize their farming practices. The platform monitors water usage, soil health, and crop growth using a network of IoT sensors, while leveraging AI and data analytics to provide insights on sustainability and resource management.

### Project Goals:
1. **Water Usage Optimization**: Reduce water wastage by tracking real-time water flow and providing irrigation alerts.
2. **Soil Health Monitoring**: Monitor soil pH, moisture, and nutrient levels to maintain healthy soil.
3. **Crop Growth Tracking**: Log crop growth stages and detect abnormalities in growth patterns through computer vision and AI.
4. **Predictive Analytics**: Use AI to predict crop yields, water needs, and soil conditions.
